## Modeling First Servo Motor - Part 1

Hi guys! :)

We are now going to start 3D modeling. While doing so, we are going to get familiar 
with the concept of 3D modeling and get to know a lot of new concepts and possibilities 
that Fusion 360 offers.

First we are going to model the __servo motor__ which is a part of the robot's hip, 
which is then a part of the robot's leg. 

It comes with the __pre-set dimensions__ that we can find __in the servo drawing__, 
which makes it possible for us to 3D model it. The robot leg drawing is also going 
to come in handy for 3D modeling the servo motor.

During your 3D modeling adventure, I am going to try to show you what part of the 
old version of the STEMI Hexapod robot we are redesigning at the moment, so that you 
can get a bigger picture of what we are doing.

Letâ€™s __grab those 2 drawings__ and get started with the 3D modeling. :)

We learnt:
* how to create __components__
* what are components
* some Fusion __shortcuts__ (for example C for the center diameter circle, L for 
line and so on) that save our time :) 
* that __S__ is shortcut for __toolbox__ (where you can find every functionality 
the Fusion 360 has)
* how to make a __sketch__
* how to make a __3D body__ out of any sketch

Quite a lot for your first 3D modeling *rendezvous*! :)

We are going to continue 3D modeling the servo motor and learning in the next video. 
See you there! :D
