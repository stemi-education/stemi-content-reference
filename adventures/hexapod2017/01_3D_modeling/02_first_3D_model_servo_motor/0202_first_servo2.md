## Modeling First Servo Motor - Part 2

Hi! :)

Last time we started 3D modeling the first servo motor and now we are going to 
continue working on it.

/youtube ALIRZ-1EXkc

Here, we learnt:
* what is a __construct line__ 
* how to __define a line__ and 
* why and how to save your current design

We are approaching the 3D modeling of a servo motor in a thorough manner, as 
you probably sensed by now. Later on, you will get more freedom but for now 
I want you to make the most out of learning the basics of 3D modeling.

See you in the next video!
