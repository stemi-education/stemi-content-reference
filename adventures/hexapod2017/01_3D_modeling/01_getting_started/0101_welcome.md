## Welcome to the 3D Modeling Adventure

Welcome to our first adventure - the __3D modeling adventure__! :)

I am very happy you are here. In this adventure you are going to learn how to 3D 
model in __Fusion 360__ and at the end of it, you will have your very own 3D model 
of the STEMI Hexapod robot version 2.

One thing I want to tell you before you start with the lessons is - to make this 
3D modeling adventure the best possible experience, I recommend __using two screens__, 
one on which you can watch the lessons and the other on which you can 3D model 
at the same time.
Now, off to the video - see you there. :)

This is the [link] (stavi link) of the .zip file the engineers sent us. Download 
and unzip it.

__Your assignment__ is to print 5 .pdf files from the .zip file you've downloaded.

See you in the next video. :)
