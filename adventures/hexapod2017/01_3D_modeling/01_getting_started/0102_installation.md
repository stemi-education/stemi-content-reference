## Installing Fusion 360

Hi there! :)

You had an assignment in the last video and that was to __print 5 .pdf files__. 
If you haven't done it yet - do it now! In this lesson, we are going to __download__ 
the program we are going to 3D model in - __Fusion 360__. Let’s go!

If you had some trouble downloading Fusion 360, here is the [link] 
(https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) to the 
page you can download it from.

One more thing to do before we start modeling is __setting preferences__ in Fusion 
360 - we’ll do it in the next video! Stay tuned. :)
